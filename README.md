# Secret-santa
This program takes in names of participants in Secret Santa and randomly assigns who gives to whom.

Use this as an easy way to randomly match people up, without worrying about drawing your own name!

Steps:

Download and unzip files in repository

Open terminal

Change into the directory in which you have stored the program files (use command "cd <directory_name>")

(Note - if the location is a subdirectory, use "cd <directory_name/sub_directory_name>" and additional "/sub_sub_directory"'s if location is deeper)

You can use commands "pwd" and "ls" to see your current directory and contents of your current directory respectively

run the command "javac Santa.java" to compile code

run the command "java Santa <first_name> <second_name> ... <last_name>" where the phrases in <> are the participants' names.
